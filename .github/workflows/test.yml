# This is the main CI workflow that runs the test suite on all pushes to main and all pull requests.
# It runs the following jobs:
# - required: runs the test suite on ubuntu with stable and beta rust toolchains
# - minimal: runs the test suite with the minimal versions of the dependencies that satisfy the
#   requirements of this crate, and its dependencies
# - os-check: runs the test suite on mac and windows
# - coverage: runs the test suite and collects coverage information
# See check.yml for information about how the concurrency cancellation and workflow triggering works

    # use llvm-cov to build and collect coverage and outputs in a format that
    # is compatible with codecov.io
    #
    # note that codecov as of v4 requires that CODECOV_TOKEN from
    #
    #   https://app.codecov.io/gh/<user or org>/<project>/settings
    #
    # is set in two places on your repo:
    #
    # - https://github.com/jonhoo/guardian/settings/secrets/actions
    # - https://github.com/jonhoo/guardian/settings/secrets/dependabot
    #
    # (the former is needed for codecov uploads to work with Dependabot PRs)
    #
    # PRs coming from forks of your repo will not have access to the token, but
    # for those, codecov allows uploading coverage reports without a token.
    # it's all a little weird and inconvenient. see
    #
    #   https://github.com/codecov/feedback/issues/112
    #
    # for lots of more discussion
